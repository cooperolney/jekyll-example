# Feast Like a Stark!

## The Great Hall

Step into the heart of Winterfell’s castle and join the feast. Long tables piled with roasted meats, stews, breads, and mulled wine invite you to eat and drink like a Stark.

The Great Hall isn’t just dining, it’s an experience.

## The Northern Hearth Tavern

For a cozier night out, head to this warm little tavern tucked just beyond the castle walls. Locals gather here for spiced cider, hot pies, and lively tales told by the fire. It’s the perfect spot to unwind after a day in the snow.
